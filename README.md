# level_design
Storage for work-in-progress level design / mod projects for retro PC games like Thief and Doom.

This repo functions as remote storage for my level design projects.
Right now the only project hosted here is House of the Architect, my work-in-progress level for Thief: The Dark Project (1998).
The .mis files are iterative versions of the level itself, including geometry, textures and objects.
'Dump' files are screenshots, viewable here on Github.
Thanks for reading.
