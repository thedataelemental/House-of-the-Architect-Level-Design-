# House of the Architect (Level Design)
Version control for my 2022 level for Thief 1 (1998), titled House of the Architect.

The .mis files are iterative versions of the level itself, including geometry, textures and objects.
'Dump' files are screenshots, viewable here on Github.
Thanks for reading.
