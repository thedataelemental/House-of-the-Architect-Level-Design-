# House of the Architect (Level Design)
Version control for my new 2022 fan level for Thief 1 (1998), titled House of the Architect.

The .mis files are iterative versions of the level itself, including geometry, textures and objects.
'Dump' files are screenshots, viewable here on Github.

This project is now completed.

Thanks for reading.
